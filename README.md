# UFC-314-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs.-Diego-Lopes-Saturday-April-12-2025-Kaseya-Center-in-Miami-Florida

his bout will crown a new UFC featherweight champion after Ilia Topuria declared the title vacant.
Fight Background
Alexander Volkanovski: The former champion at featherweight is coming off a rough patch, having lost uncompetitive knockouts to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria in title bouts. Now, he is returning from a 14-month recovery break to reassert his dominance in the featherweight division. Volkanovski’s signature precision, distance management, and grappling defense made him one of the most technically sound fighters in the history of MMA.
Diego Lopes: Lopes has quickly risen up the featherweight ranks, so much so that a first title shot comes for him after defeating elite contenders such as Brian Ortega and Dan Ige. A powerful threat in his feet and a decent ground game, Lopes can be chaotic and dangerous in exchanges and has been tough in 3 rounds. His wrestling and defensive striking, however, could be holes that a savvy veteran like Volkanovski could exploit.
Key Factors in the Fight
Alexander Volkanovski’s Peak Form: Questions remain whether Volkanovski can return to his peak form after two knockout losses late in his career. Depending on how he fights against Max Holloway or Yair Rodriguez, he should have a big advantage with striking mechanics and fight IQ.
Lopes Raw Power Lopes is a threat anywhere in the octagon, with big power and unconventional aggression. His early round onslaught was certainly a threat to Volkanovski who has shown new suspect takedown defense as of late.
Grapple Game Buffs: Lopes is an elite submission and scrambler wizard, but Volkanovski has rendered elite grapplers ineffective throughout his career, including Brian Ortega and Islam Makhachev. The difficulties Lopes will face are finding the openings to get the fight to where he fights best without putting himself in harm's way.
Cardio And Championship Rounds: Volkanovski’s conditioning has been a pillar of his career, enabling him to overwhelm foes in the later rounds. Lopes on the other hand must knock Volkanovski out early or fatigue will take over while he lets the Small Man in through the gaps.
